# Project 2: Visualization of Autoregressive(AR) Models 

## Overview
- This project aims to explore and visually demonstrate how autoregressive (AR) models operate, specifically how different parameters and AR orders impact the structure and behavior of a time series. 
We will generate synthetic data for these AR models and create visualizations from the data. We will also create a shiny app that enables the users to change parameters and plot the line graph.
